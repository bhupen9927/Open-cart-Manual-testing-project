# Open-cart-Manual-testing-project
In this project I create the test planning, meticulously created test cases, reviewed the RTM, managed environment setup, and oversaw build deployment. During the execution phase, I played a pivotal role in bug reporting, tracking, and conducted extensive re-testing, including comprehensive regression tests, ensuring the system's unwavering stability and readiness for release sign-off.
Project Overview
The manual testing project for OpenCart involves thoroughly testing various aspects of the website, including its user interface, navigation, product listing, cart management, checkout process, user registration, and any other features relevant to the online shopping experience. The goal is to identify bugs, usability issues, and potential improvements to enhance the website's performance and user satisfaction.

Testing Approach:-
The project follows a systematic approach to manual testing, which typically includes the following steps:

Test Planning:-
Understanding the requirements and defining the scope of testing. This involves identifying the different scenarios, user flows, and test cases to be executed.

Test Case Design:-
Creating detailed test cases that cover different functionalities and user interactions. Test cases may include steps to navigate the website, input valid and invalid data, and verify expected results.

Test Execution:-
Performing the manual tests based on the defined test cases. This involves interacting with the website, following the specified steps, and recording any issues or observations encountered during the testing process.

Defect Reporting:-
Documenting and reporting any defects, bugs, or usability issues discovered during testing. Each issue should include a clear description, steps to reproduce, and relevant screenshots or error messages.

Test Results Documentation:-
Compiling the test results, including the status of each test case, any deviations from expected behavior, and the overall assessment of the website's performance.
